#Personal Bio
Hey, my name is Michael Ambrose. I'm from Long Island, NY and I'm a graduate from the class of 2020
in Floral Park Memorial High School. I love to play video games, code, and hangout with friends. 
I wouldn't consider these hobbies but I do these mainly every day.

#What I'd like to learn from this course

- _Teamwork_
- _Practice team ethics_
- _Efficient communication_
- _Establish career lasting relationships/connections_
- _The concept of being a Software Engineer_
